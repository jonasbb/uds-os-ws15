First the kernel verifies that the provided string is a valid string
for this user process. Then this string is passed to process_execute,
where any trailing spaces get ignored. Here we also extract the file name
of the new process. The string (without leading spaces) is copied onto
a new page which is passed to start_process which passes it to load which
passes it to setup_stack().
In setup_stack() we allocate a new user space page and copy the content onto
the new page. We install this new page into the page table of the new process.
We then call strtok_r for all values on this new page. Each return value is
put onto the stack for the new process. Finally, we reverse the order of char*
on the stack to get the correct layout.
Because we copy all string arguments onto a new page we have a complete page
for argc and argv arguments.
We also ensure, for each entry in argv, that the stack has enough space to hold
3 more values, the stack frame for calling a function, and the struct thread
which always resides at the bottom of the thread page.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
strtok() is not thread secure, meaning if multiple threads use it independently
of each other the results will be unpredictable.

Quote from the documentation:
    Uses global data, so it is unsafe in threaded programs such as kernels. Use
	strtok_r() instead, and see its source code in lib/string.c for documentation
	and an example. 

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name

Argument parsing handles untrusted user input. It is therefore more secure
to do userspace parsing as failures or programming errors cannot corrupt the kernel.
It is also possible to support different escaping schemas e.g. to pass a
space as an argument.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
File descriptors are generated independently for each process as
a unique increasing sequence starting with value 2 as the values
0 and 1 are reserved for special purpose.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.
Our kernel first performs a validation step for reference data like
void* or char*. Afterwards it uses the fact that we always have virtual
memory and use the given pointers directly as the page table is
still the same.

To validate char* we search for the end of string (\0) and verify that
the user process owns each page, before we derefference the char*.
Validation of void* is similar, but we increment the pointer always
to the start of the next page, as we only need to check, that the user
process owns each page, but do not need to check for the end as we
are given the size of the buffer.
If any page is not owned by the user process the process is terminated.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data

>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about

>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?
Each system call might use a different number of checks, one for each
argument, which we will ignore here, but because we have at least one
parameter this will be at least one.

The pointer is passed down to validate_user_buffer or validate_user_string.
For each page in the range they call once uaddr_to_kaddr which calls
pagedir_get_page() one time, so we have one call to pagedir_get_page()
per actual page with data. A full page of data can occupy one page fully
or two pages partially but never three pages, if the range is consecutive.
The same holds true for two bytes, they may occupy one page or two pages.
The minimal number is one and the maximum is two in both cases. Improvements
could only be made if we require the data to be on one page e.g. by
changing the syscall API such that all pointers must start at the beginning
of a page, which forces both inputs to only occupy one page.
Other improvements are not possible as we need to check each page once.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.
Our syscall only calls process_wait which is blocking until the return
value is known. All interactions with process termination are handled
in process_wait, but the most important part is a wait on a condition.
See B8 for details.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?
The parameter struct given to start_process contains a semaphore for
synchronization. We use a binary semaphore instead of a lock to ensure
that the parent process never can precede until the child knows its
status. If the child either has started successfully or not it sets
a status bit in the parameter struct. Only two processes have access
to this struct, parent and child, and the parent waits on the semaphore
before accessing the status bit. The child never touches the struct
after calling sema_up so no data races are possible here.
Depending on this status bit we either return -1 or the new pid.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?
We introduced a new struct process_state_item which keeps track of all
the resources and states associated with a process. It includes a list
of child pids, the process exit value and the parent pid.
All access to the array of process_state_item, each process_state_item
and all values in process_state_item are protected with the pid_lock
such that no race conditions can occur. There are no other unprotected
shared memory accesses.

Exit of processes.
Always: Cleanup for child processes
	All child processes lose their parent in this process, so they will not
	use resources, even though no parent will ever call wait. All child
	processes which already terminated and are now zombies are also cleaned up.

Case 1: Parent process is still running
	The process performs its child cleanup. Afterwards it keeps the exit
	status and sets the process state to zombie meaning wait can be called
	and the process already terminated.
Case 2: Parent process not running
	Cleanup all resources, do not keep exit status as wait can never be
	called.

Furthermore, our cleanup function clear_process_state_ in process.c,
which resets our process_state_items releases all resources, so that
even if cleanup is skiped before, at the last point we always release
resources.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?
Performing a check first is easy to implement. The downside is the overhead
in performance for correctly working user processes as every time the
arguments are checked. If we know all memory accesses within the bounds,
either string end or size for buffer, are valid all further processing
only needs to ensure that it only accesses the buffers correct, which
is much more easy.
Further, the documentation mentioned this as the easier case so we
implemented it this way.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
Creating a new value for filedescriptor instead of using the struct file*
hides pointers to kernel data, which might give an attacker easier access
to important kernel datastructures, as he has a memory location to start
with. This is a better seperation between user and kernel space.
This also allows for better checking of validity of user supplied data
compared to the case we would use pointers as file descriptors.

Obvious disadvantage is that each access via file descriptors triggers
a lookup in a linked list to search for the correct struct file*.
This is overhead compared to the case that we would use the struct
file* as file descriptor.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?
We sample pid_t's from a new range of PID_MAX many values starting
with 0. The first user process therefore has pid 1. Creating a new
value hides pointers to kernel data, which might give an attacker
easier access to important kernel datastructures, as he has a memory
location to start with. This is a better seperation between user
and kernel space. More importantly this change allows us to store
all process_state_items in a large array with fast access instead of
using a list to search for each pid.
