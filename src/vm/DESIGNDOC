		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.
We use a basic clock swipe algorithm.
We iterate over our frame table until we find a suitable frame to evict.
We skip all pinned frames.
We skip frames we are not able to evict, because we don't know who "owns" them.
If the accessed bit is set we clear it and it gets a second chance.
Any pages we are now left with are suitable. If the page is writable
we write it back to file or swap before eviction.
Then the frame is free for eviction.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?
The first step is removing the present bit in the page table of Q
for the virtual address mapped to a frame. This quarantees that we
can savely assign the frame to another process (as long as we are
able to restore the content). If the present bit is not set the
bits for the virtual addresses have no defined use, we do not need
to delete the physical address in the page table. We add correct
entries in the supplementary page table of Q to restore the frame
again if they are not already present. We are now free to reuse
the frame for P.

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.
The documentation describes that PUSH and PUSHA may fault up to
32 *below* the stack pointer. In the Software Reverse Engineering lecture
we learned that the value in ESP *must* be lower or equal to any accesses
on the stack (for the x86 ABI). Additionally the stack must be limited
in total size. We combine these rules.

A page fault will extend the stack if it faults no more than 32 byte
below the stack pointer and the fault address is at most 2MB from
the top of the stack.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)
There are four conditions which must all be met for the possibility
of a page fault.
1. Mutually exclusive access
2. No resource preemption
3. Hold and wait
4. Cycle in wait-for graph

These map to our implementation in the following way:
1. The lock for the VM subsystem is exclusive. This condition is met.
2. A lock may only be released by the thread holding it. It cannot be
   preempted. This conditions is met.
3. We do not restrict that a process may hold multiple resources. The
   swap subsystem uses a different lock which can only be tried to be aquired
   while holding the VM lock. No process will ever need to wait for the
   swap lock. This condition is met.
4. There is only one VM lock. All lock accesses to the swap lock must first
   aquire the VM lock, so there is no cycle there. The filesystem lock
   could be problematic, but syscalls will first pin all pages, so that
   the VM lock will never be needed while performing the actual syscall
   which means there can never be a dependency from the filesystem lock
   to the VM lock. This conditions is not met.

There can never be any deadlocks in our system as only 3/4 conditions
are met.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?
The page to be evicted is first made inaccessible by removing the present
bit for this page in Q's page table. Any further accesses of Q will
result in a page fault. Before the page fault can be handled Q needs
to aquire the lock still held by P. P has all the time it needs to
do the work needed to evict the page without Q being able to swap
anything back in. As soon as P finishes the virtual memory handling
and releases the lock Q may precede and swap the page back in.

We have a single global lock which covers the page table, supplementary
page table and frame table. At least one of those is required for a
page fault and evicting frames. All accesses are sequential so no
data races are possible.

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur

In the last project we implemented a check-then-access pattern for
user memory in syscalls. This allowed us to easily extend the `check`
part to also handle memory.
While we test whether the user process owns the addresses, which it gave to
us as parameters, we load all virtual addresses in the user space
and pin the corresponding frame.
We have a single function which loads the pages in case of a page fault
and we reuse it to assert that all pages are loaded, if not already
present in the page table, and all frames pinned.
This function notifies us if the loading of a page failed, which means
it was never before assigned as a valid virtual address for this
user process. We can then terminate the offending process.
Afterwards we unpin all frames previously pinned.

We decided to use a single lock for the whole memory subsystem which
includes the page tables (pagedir.c) for all threads, frame table (frames.c)
and supplementary page table (spage.c). Reasons for this decision include:
1. It is much more easy to implement locking correctly.
2. Those three files are heavily depending on each other which makes
   figuring out a sensible log order aquiring, which avoids deadlocks, at
   least, complicated.
3. We are behind the deadline and do not want to waste time one a more
   efficient implementation if not necessary.


			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
Many/Most of the entries in B1 also apply to this answer, as memory mapped files
are just one special case of our VM system.
Therefore, only definitions ONLY applying to mapped files are listed here, to avoid
duplications.

typedef int mapid_t;
; redeclaration of mapid

struct mmapdata {
  mapid_t mapid;
  void *base_addr;
  size_t pgcount;
  struct file *file;
};
; storage of a list of all mmaps in process.c and communication with
; syscalls

in struct process_state_item:
// mmaped files
int nextmapid;
struct list mmaplist;
; management of mapped files per process

struct mmaplist_item
{
  struct list_elem elem;
  struct mmapdata data;
};
; list item for above list

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.
Our memory subsystem has a hash map for all virtual addresses which
have another location where the data is stored, the backing store (supplementary page table).
The backing store can be a file, a zero page or the swap.
If a page fault occurs for an address where we also have a backing
location we get all needed information like the file, offset and length
or the location within the swap which allow us to load the data.
We can then load the data and map the page as present again in the
page table for the user process.

The eviction process differs a lot more.
Any non writable pages will never be written to swap, so we can
ignore those. All non-writable pages can always be restored from
the backing file.
mmaped files will be written to the file. We use the supplementary
page table to figure out to which part of the file we need to write
back and then call file_write_at(). We can then reuse the frame.
For pages which need to be written to the swap device we call a
method which stores a page onto the device and gives us back an id
which allows us to get it back. This id is stored to the supplementary
page table. The writing method for the swap device searches for a
free space and writes the page in multiple blocks to the device.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.
Every mapping we create, if it is a file, a segment, stack, mmaps,
will create a dummy entry in the page table. This dummy address will
set one of the three bits available for operating system use.
We use this bit to note all virtual pages which are valid for the
user process to access.
If a mapping becomes invalid, especially munmap(), we remove this
bit for all pages which were mapped before. This keeps the page
table consistent.
For a new file mapping we search in the page table all virtual
addresses which we need to successfully map the new file. If any
of those addresses is already present in the page table with
this bit set we cannot map this file as it is too large for this
virtual address.
We then indicate an error to the user process.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of

Our supplementary page table distinguishes between three types of backing
stores. A backing store is another location where the data of a page may
be located. This can be a file, the swap or nothing in case the page
is all zeros.
Loading from a segment uses both the file and zero backing.
The file mapping for segments and file mappings for mmaps share the exact
same implementation in the backing store, with the exeption of an additional
flag bit only set for mmaped backing to distinguish them later.
Our implementation always uses the same code path where possible and
most of the time only has additional code pathes one of the cases.
For example in frame_evict() we need additional code to handle the writeback
of mmaped files. Segments which are mapped as not writeable do not need any
handling at all and writeable segments handle the same as any swap segment
like stack.
We chose this way as this allowed us a fast way to implement loading of
data and it seemed simpler as those code paths are often the same.
We implemented write back of pages later. More differences are in these
code paths but since our framework already was present we didn't change it
to different implementations. We also didn't see a need to do this.
