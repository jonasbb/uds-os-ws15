    		     PROD/CONS
	  		     =========

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B1: How does your solution guarantee that consumers will hold until
>> there is something to consume in the buffer?
The pop method waits if the buffer is empty. It waits on the non_empty condition,
which is only ever signaled by the put method after it has put something in the buffer.
Only one consumer is ever woken up, so that the buffer is always non_empty after the
return from cond_wait. To be sure and to future proove our code we recheck the condition
anyway in a while loop and re-wait on the same condition if the buffer is empty.
This way we could also use broadcast instead of signal to wake up threads.

>> B2: How does your solution guarantee that producers will hold until
>> there is some free space in the buffer?
Analoge to B1, just with switched pop/put methods and non_empty/non_full conditions.

The put method waits if the buffer is full. It waits on the non_full condition,
which is only ever signaled by the pop method after it has popped something from the buffer.
Only one producer is ever woken up, so that the buffer is always non_full after the
return from cond_wait. To be sure and to future proove our code we recheck the condition
anyway in a while loop and re-wait on the same condition if the buffer is full.
This way we could also use broadcast instead of signal to wake up threads.

>> B3: How does your solution preserve a FIFO semantics i.e., the first
>> character produced will be the first to be consumed?
We use a ringbuffer `buf` with the pointer `buf_in` and `buf_out`. The pointers
point to the next place in the buffer to write to or read from. Because they always
move in the same direction (increasing, wrap aroung to 0 at buffer size) characters
are read in the same order they were written in, thus preserving the FIFO semantics.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B4: Give an intuition for why your program preserves safety.
Only the access to the variables `buf*` could potentially create race conditions.
We have three positions, where we access the variables, in producer_consumer, in put,
and in pop. In producer_consumer only one thread runs at this time, thus no race conditions
can occur. put and pop are called from producer and consumer which run potentially als multiple
threads in parallel. Both, put and pop, have lock_acquire as their first call, both on the same lock.
The access to `buf*` variables in both functions is therefore always protected by the lock and no
race conditions can occure.

>> B5: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design 
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?
We learned this exact design in NP (see sources on top) so it was the easiest to implement.
Furthermore, the documentation already contains code for put/pop which it was compared to
to check for correct implementation of the critical sections.
http://courses.mpi-sws.org/os-ws15/assignments/pintos/pintos_6.html#SEC101

We did not consider other designs, because it is the most familiar design.

			     NARROW BRIDGE
			     =============

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C1: How does your solution guarantee that no more that 3 vehicles 
>> are crossing the bridge in the same direction?
The number of vehicles in the opposite direction must be 0 and the number of
vehicles in the same direction as the current vehicle must be less than 3.
This condition must be met for each vehicle in the while loop within arrive_bridge
to continue. Only after it has left the while loop a thread can exit from
arrive_bridge.

>> C2: What prevents vehicles from opposite directions from crossing the
>> bridge simultaneously?
The number of vehicles in the opposite direction must be 0. This condition
is checked before leaving arrive_bridge in the while loop.

>> C3: How does your solution grant priority to emergency vehicles over
>> the queue of vehicles ahead in the same direction?
Not emergency vehicles will never drive on the bridge if any emergency vehicle is
waiting. This is checked in the while loop before exiting the arrive_bridge function.

>> C4: How do you guarantee that despite having priority, emergency vehicles
>> do not start crossing the bridge while there are still vehicles crossing
>> it in the oposite direction?
Same as C2. The check does not consider the priority.

>> C5: Explain with examples why your solution does not preserve neither 
>> fairness nor freedom from starvation, other than what has been indicated 
>> for emergency vehicles.
Our implementation never changes the direction if both sides have waiting emergency vehicles.
So if a stream of emergency vehicles arrives faster than they can cross the bridge neither the
other side nor normal vehicles in the same direction can ever cross the bridge.

Also, if the stream of emergency vehicles from both sides exceeds the capacity of the bridge, but
neither stream exceeds the capacity by itself, normal vehicles will also never cross the bridge
because they must wait till all emergency vehicles have crossed.

Similar, if only normal vehicles arrive at the bridge, faster than they can cross the bridge in this
direction we will also not change the direction.

We will only ever change direction if one side has emergency vehicles waiting but the other side, in the
current direction, does not, or if the current side has no vehicles left waiting and the other side any
vehicles waiting.

>> C6: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design 
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?
We had a design variant with conditions in Nebenläufige Programmierung. We tried to
build a design similar to this but replacing the conditions with semaphores. One way
to do this would have been to implement conditions with semaphores, which we though
of being not the intended solution, so we discarded it. We now use four semaphores,
one for each direction and priority. This allows us to wake up exactly those threads
corresponding to vehicles of a particular kind. By intelligently waking up threads,
meaning only threads which can proceed now and never more than can preceed now simultaniously
and always wake up the maximal amount of threads which can proceed now to allow the maximal
throughput.

This design is superiour to our initial implementation design using a single condition
for all thread in the way that no thread is ever woken up which cannot proceed in the
current situation.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.
